                                    <li className='li_tag_privacy'><hr /><h3><strong>Streaming PPR</strong></h3> Streaming PPR is not a single feature, but a combination of technologies in Next.js that enable progressive, performance-driven rendering. It enhances how content is streamed (sent to the client) through techniques like - <br /> <i>Streaming and Partial/Progressive Page Rendering (PPR)</i>. <br /> <br /> <h4><strong>Streaming</strong></h4>  <div className='LeftMargin'><h5><strong>What is Streaming in Next.js?</strong></h5>In Next.js, streaming is a technique that allows you to progressively send the parts (chunks) of a webpage from the server to the client as soon as they are ready instead of waiting for the entire page to be rendered on the server. This process is often called Streaming Server-Side Rendering. <br /> <h5><strong>How does Streaming works in Next.js?</strong></h5> When a user sends a request to a page, Next.js starts rendering components (on the server). If a component needs to perform an asynchronous operation (such as fetching data from the API), then Next.js sends other components to the client (such as headers and footers). The React Suspense Component is the backbone of the Streaming PPR. (Wrap the component that will perform an asynchronous operation inside the suspense boundaries in our page or route.). In simple words, it sends the HTML of a page in parts. Once the asynchronous operation is completed, the server sends the remaining portion (remaining HTML) to the client. </div> <br /> <h4><strong>PPR (Partial Prerendering):</strong></h4> <div className='LeftMargin'> <h5><strong>What is PPR in Next.js?</strong></h5>In Next.js, PPR is a technique that makes your page static as much as possible to enhance performance while still allowing some parts of the page to be dynamic when needed. (NOTE: Partial prerendering is an experimental feature only; please do not use it in your production). <br /> <h5><strong>How does PPR works in Next.js?</strong></h5>Next.js analyzes your React component tree for a given page. It identifies which components are rendered statically or dynamically, then it generates initial HTML for these statically rendered components, and Next.js renders a placeholder (empty spaces) for the dynamic components. The content inside React Suspense boundaries usually forms a placeholder. In simple words, you can create your page as static or dynamic as per your requirement. You don't need to make your page fully static or dynamic.</div> <br /> <h6><strong>How Streaming and PPR (Partial Prerendering) work together to enhance the performance and user experience?</strong></h6> First, the Partial/Progressive Prerendering generates the initial HTML of the static component and renders placeholders for dynamic content at build time, and when a user sends the request to access this page, the initial HTML (generated at build time with placeholders for dynamic content) is sent or rendered instantly to the user. At the same time, the server prepares the dynamic data for sending it to the client as soon as it is prepared and sends it progressively to the user, and then Next. JS performs the hydration process (making the page interactive). <br /> <br /> <h6><strong>When should we need to use Streaming PPR?</strong></h6>While you should need to use these techniques when your pages are static and dynamic at the same time, such as on an e-commerce website's products page, there are many components to render, such as images, titles, descriptions, etc. of products. This data is constant, meaning this data does not change frequently or every time you request it, so this is static data, which means you don't need any server-side rendering to render these components. At the same time, the same page contains some dynamic components, such as price, customer reviews, and availability of the product. These are dynamic content; they may change from time to time, so these components need server-side rendering to be rendered. So, it will be beneficial to use Streaming PPR in these types of situations. <br /> <br /></li>
                                    <li className='li_tag_privacy'><div><hr /><h3><strong>Prefetching Link</strong></h3>In Next.js Prefetching using the Link component is a powerful performance optimization technique that enables blazing-fast transitions between pages by loading the necessary resources in advance. <br /> <br /> <h5><strong>How Does Prefetching Work?</strong></h5>When a Link becomes visible in the viewport, Next.js automatically preloads: <br /> The page's JavaScript bundle or any static data required by that page (if using getStaticProps) <br /> These resources are fetched in the background — before the user clicks the link. As a result, when the user does navigate, the browser already has everything it needs, making the transition feel instant and seamless. <br /> <br /> <h5><strong>How to Use or Control Prefetching?</strong></h5> You don’t need to do anything special to enable it — prefetching is on by default in production when using the Link component from 'next/link.' <br /> If you want to manually control the prefetch behavior, you can use the prefetch prop: <br /> Example: <br /> {<CodeBox code={PrefetchingCode} />} <br /> <strong>This prop accepts:</strong><p className='pl-7'><b>null</b> (or omit the prop) — Let Next.js decide based on route type:</p> <p className='pl-12'>Static routes → Fully prefetched (HTML + data).</p> <p className='pl-12'>Dynamic routes → Prefetch only up to the nearest segment that has a loading.js boundary (in the App Router).</p> <p className='pl-7'><b>true</b> — Prefetch the full route, including static and dynamic segments.</p> <p className='pl-7'><b>false</b> — Disable prefetching entirely.</p> <br /> <h4><strong>Drawbacks of Prefetching Link in Next.js:</strong></h4> While prefetching in Next.js can significantly improve navigation speed, using it without consideration can negatively impact your site’s performance and user experience. <br /> <br /> <strong>Unnecessary Network Requests & Bandwidth Waste</strong> <br /> If your page contains many links — such as in a blog listing or navigation menu — and all of them are prefetched automatically, it can trigger a large number of background requests. <br /> <p className='pl-7'>This leads to heavy network usage, even for pages the user may never visit.</p> <p className='pl-7'>On slow or unstable internet connections, this can delay the loading of critical resources and result in a poor user experience.</p> <br /> <strong>Increased Server Load:</strong> <br /> Although static pages are often served from a CDN, prefetching dynamic content (e.g., via getServerSideProps) can generate unnecessary traffic to your backend. <p className='pl-7'>This can cause increased server load, especially on high-traffic sites.</p> <p className='pl-7'>It may lead to slower responses, timeout issues, or server instability.</p> <br /><strong>Higher Resource Consumption on User Devices:</strong> <br /> Prefetching consumes memory and CPU because it downloads, parses, and sometimes caches JavaScript files and data in advance. <br /> On low-end devices, this can: <br /> <p className='pl-7'>Slow down the browser</p> <p className='pl-7'>Increase memory usage</p> <p className='pl-7'>Cause the site to crash or behave laggily</p> <br /> <strong>Don’t use prefetching blindly. While it improves speed, it should be applied strategically to avoid overwhelming the network, server, or user's device.</strong> </div></li>
